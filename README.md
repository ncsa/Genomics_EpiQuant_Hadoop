# SEMS-Hadoop

SEMS-Hadoop is a program developed at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications in collaboration with the Center for
Computational Biotechnology and Genomic Medicine to map epistatic gene
interactions utilizing MapReduce for scalable distributed computing. It uses
step-wise linear regression model selection to build a cumulative statistical
model of epistatic interactions between SNP's and phenotypes.

## Usage

A bash script is included to build, package, and run SEMS-Hadoop. Simply call

    ./run.sh
